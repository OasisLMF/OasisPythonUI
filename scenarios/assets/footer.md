DISCLAIMER: No contributors to this repository, namely the third-party model providers, brokers, insurers or reinsurers take any
responsibility for the outputs produced from these scenarios or deterministic models. Although the providers of the scenarios have
ensured the hazard data captured within the footprint files is as accurate as possible, the event losses produced may vary from those
in the full stochastic model from the same vendor. These scenarios may also be accompanied by different (or simplified) vulnerability
functions which will produce different losses and so do not reflect the company's "true" view of risk for these events.
